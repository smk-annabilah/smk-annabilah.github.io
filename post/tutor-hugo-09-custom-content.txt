Custom Content Type

-- -- -- Theme 04 - 07 -- -- -- Prepare -- -- --

We can make a custom content for archiving.

Remember our last archive page ?

* content/pages/archives.md

+++
type  = "archives"
title = "Archives by Date"
+++

-- -- --

Instead of just html page, we will enhanced this archive,
to output different custom content type.

+++
type  = "archives"
title = "Archives by Date"
outputs = ["html", "txt", "yml", "json"]
+++

Why do we even need these custom outputs ?

* The HTML, we already seen in previous chapter

* The JSON artefact as a search data source for lunr json.

* The YAML artefact to build data source for related pages,
  something that you usually seen in wordpress posts.

* The plain text artefact, is just another demo.
  Because not every browser can handle yaml type,
  I use the plain fo easiness reason

In order to do this,
we need to make a little adjustment in our beloved config file.
Making some new definition in config.toml.

* config.toml

# An example of Hugo site for tutorial purpose.

...

[mediaTypes]
  [mediaTypes."text/yaml"]
    suffix = "yml"

[outputFormats]
  [outputFormats.yml]
    baseName    = "index"
    mediaType   = "text/yaml"
    isPlainText = true
  [outputFormats.txt]
    baseName    = "index"
    mediaType   = "text/plain"
    isPlainText = true

* JSON is already a standard output type.
  So we don't need to change anything.

* On the other hand, we need to define YAML mediaTypes.

* However, we still need to define txt output formats.

Preparation

We need these two artefacts.

$ touch themes/tutor-04/layouts/archives/baseof.json.json
$ touch themes/tutor-04/layouts/archives/single.json.json

We have already this archives.md, no need to recreate.

$ cat content/pages/archives.md

-- -- --

Our base is as simply as this below.

* themes/tutor-04/layouts/archives/baseof.json.json

{{ block "main" .}}{{ end }}

-- -- --

The detail is in 

* themes/tutor-04/layouts/archives/single.json.json

{{ define "main" }}
{{- $posts := where .Site.Pages "Type" "post" -}}
{{- $postCount := len $posts -}}
{
  {{ range $i, $e := $posts }}
    "{{ .URL | urlize }}": {
      "title": {{ jsonify $e.Title }},
      "content": {{ jsonify ($e.Params.excerpt | default $e.Summary) }},
      "url": {{ jsonify .Permalink }},
      "author": {{ jsonify $e.Params.author }},
      "category": {{ jsonify $e.Section  }}
    }
    {{- if not (eq (add $i 1) $postCount) }},{{ end -}}
  {{ end }}
}
{{ end }}

-- -- --

* http://localhost:1313/pages/archives/index.json

This will produce something like

{
  
    "/quotes/2018/09/13/mothers-no-crying-in-baseball/": {
      "title": "Mothers - No Crying in Baseball",
      "content": "There\u0026rsquo;s no crying in baseball. Try to understand.",
      "url": "http://localhost:1313/quotes/2018/09/13/mothers-no-crying-in-baseball/",
      "author": "epsi",
      "category": "quotes"
    },
    "/quotes/2018/09/07/julian-baker-something/": {
      ...
    },
    ...
}

Preparation

We need these two artefacts.

$ touch themes/tutor-04/layouts/archives/baseof.yml.yml
$ touch themes/tutor-04/layouts/archives/single.yml.yml
$ touch themes/tutor-04/layouts/archives/baseof.txt.txt
$ touch themes/tutor-04/layouts/archives/single.txt.txt

We have already the archives.md.

-- -- --

Our base for both yml and txt, are as simply as this below.

* themes/tutor-04/layouts/archives/baseof.yml.yml
* themes/tutor-04/layouts/archives/baseof.txt.txt

{{ block "main" .}}{{ end }}

-- -- --

The detail is in 

* themes/tutor-04/layouts/archives/baseof.txt.txt
* themes/tutor-04/layouts/archives/single.txt.txt

{{- define "main" -}}
# Helper for related links
# {{ .Title }}

{{ range (where .Site.Pages "Type" "post") }}
  {{- if .Date }}
- id: {{ .Date.Format "06010204" }}
  title: "{{ .Title }}"
  url: {{ .URL }}
  {{ end -}}
{{ end }}

{{- end -}}

-- -- --

* http://localhost:1313/pages/archives/index.txt

This will produce something like:

# Helper for related links
# Archives by Date

- id: 18091335
  title: "Mothers - No Crying in Baseball"
  url: /quotes/2018/09/13/mothers-no-crying-in-baseball/
  
- id: 18090735
  title: "Julian Baker - Something"
  url: /quotes/2018/09/07/julian-baker-something/

So we can easily copy paste the output to any text editor.

* http://localhost:1313/pages/archives/index.yml

Since no handle for text/yaml in browser,
the browser will ask if it should be downloaded


So we can easily copy paste the output to any text editor.

Since we have four type, we have four single layouts.
